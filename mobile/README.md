# Expo Mobile app

This app is the "client" that users will use.

It's built off of expo, which is a react native wrapper. I chose expo because it handles complicated things, like notifcations, for me.

This app accomplishes many things: it allows users to create and login into accounts, view past water leaks, and recieve real time data about new leaks (either in the app, or through a notification).
